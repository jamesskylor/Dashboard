For all js files, make the following:

- Set the placeholder values to values retrieved from the server
- Create event listeners for all buttons   
    - Create functions to handle the logic of checking everything and sending to the server
    
- Maybe make a check function that as soon as a input is unfocused, if the value is invalid, display a message
