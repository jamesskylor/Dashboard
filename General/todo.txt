Jason (organize thoughts):
(2 hr [Mostly on making the page itself, not the implementation of the passwords])
- Add id to sessionStorage during login
   - Use /id
   - Display proper error messages when failed login
   - Remember to teach how to use Postman for password reset
- Use that to fetch everything (Go through .js and just quickly edit things)

(1 hr)
- Create limit to size of image and just do everything as base64 string
- Make js that resized to ~100*100px

(5 min)
- Use part of Tania Rascia's tutorial to cat in the new init.sql file
   - Remember to use Postman to hash the password since the hashing is in express, not postgres
   
(1 hr)
- Drop the CoFounders



(0.5 hr)
- Ask how to integrate Philips code into a site
- Add Philip's code

(2 hr)
